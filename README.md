The Traffic Light Problem
==============================

Using React and Node your tasked with building a user interface and API for two sets of lights. A set of lights has both a red and green light and only one light on each set can be lit (imagine a simple traffic light with only red and green). Your goal is to:

 - Show two of these sets of lights and visibly show which colour on each light is lit. Imagine these two lights are at opposite ends of the road. Use the JSON API to return the status of these two lights, clearly showing which light (on which set) should be on. 

 - Include a JSON API to swap the two lights over. So, on swap if one light is green then it should show red lit and the other one which was red should now show green lit. 

 - Ensure the update to the lights is made in the UI.
